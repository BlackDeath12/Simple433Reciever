## WARNING: This is an outdated code!
(For an updated version of this code which uses a Python library that's easier to use, go to my other repository, [receiverLibrary](https://github.com/BlackDeath12/receiverLibrary)

Simple 433mhz radio receiver protocol that checks if a binary code is received by a radio module that outputs digital signals. Based on the Manchester Code. 

Intended for receiving simple radio signals using microcontrollers. A library that handles this algorithm is being developed.

Tested on a Raspberry Pi Pico.
