Simple 433mhz radio receiver protocol that checks if a binary code is received by a radio module that outputs digital signals. Based on the Manchester Code. 

Intended for receiving simple radio signals using microcontrollers. A library that handles this algorithm is being developed. Check my other repository: receiverLibrary.

Tested on a Raspberry Pi Pico.
